# Reply Templates
Templates for the Reply Code Challenge, in many different languages. Use them to avoid rewriting boilerplate code every time.

## How to use
Clone this repository and get the template for a programming language. Alternatively, download the file directly.

## Design
The Reply Code Challenge is designed so that you upload an output file, instead of uploading source code which is run on the server. This means instead of the Standard input and output, files are used.

The templates provided are designed to have few functions, and to be concise. Because you never know what the Reply Code Masters will throw at you, these include most of the standard libraries of the languages.
